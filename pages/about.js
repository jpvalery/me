            I believe it's hard to summarize a person in a few paragraphs but
            I'll give it a shot.{" "}

            So, I'm Jp. Well, technically <em>Jean-Pierre</em> if you're going
            to ask but everybody has always called me Jp.

            I was born in France in 1992 and I lived there until I moved to
            Montr√©al in 2014. I became a dual-citizen in 2020.

            I'm currently in between roles. My expertise is in growth operations
            and customer success.

            Before that, I've dabbled in{" "}
            <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jpvalery">quite a few things</a>.
            From freelancing to multinationals, from the music industry to the
            video game industry, from marketing to RevOps.

            I like to keep things fresh and interesting. That being said, I
            think I finally found my sweet spot in seed-stage/series A startups.
            I offer <a href="https://growthmontreal.com">advisorship</a> to
            offer my experience and tips.

            Photography has been a huge component of my life for the past
            decade. My pictures have been viewed over 130,000,000 times on{" "}
            <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jpvalery">Unsplash</a>, have been
            published in 2 books, and exhibited once. The last year didn't
            really motivate me to take any pictures but I hope to get back to
            it.

            I'm also a gamer. I've been playing mostly on Xbox for the past few
            years but I hop on a computer regularly to hone my piloting skills
            on simulators.

            Last but not least, I'm really into gardening. This must be in my
            genes from my great-grandfather who was a farmer. It's like
            meditation to me and I crave the taste of fresh produce.
            Tangentially, I'm interested in homesteading and self-sufficieny.
            Hoping to buy a farmland in the future to have the space to indulge
            in that hobby.
