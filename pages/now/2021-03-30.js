          2021 started pretty crazyâ€”no reasons to change the winning recipe of
          2020, eh?

          I left my role at Local Logic in February. I tried to get alignment on
          my future at the company after blowing past all my objectives and
          working non-stop for a year. I was told to quit. So, I went{" "}
          <em>yolo</em> and did just that.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to say I'm pretty proud of me for doing so. It was both a crazy
          and a courageous choice to draw the line and say "no more". I think
          that a few years ago I would have kept enduring the abuse and
          toxicity, rather than calling it quits

          I got a couple of freelancing gigs to keep me busy while I was
          enjoying funemployment and I landed a role at Customer.io as a
          Customer Success Manager. If you ran into me over the past few years
          and we chatted about marketing automation, there's a 99.999% chance I
          annoyed you with how freaking awesome Customer.io is as a product. So,
          I couldn't be more excited to be joining this team.

          These days I'm playing mostly Apex Legends, Dead by Daylight, H:CotW.
          I'm looking forward to jumping back a bit more on Flight Simulator,
          especially with an Oculus Quest on the way.

          I've started my seedlings for the season and as usual I'm just amazed
          by these lil' plants making their way up through the soil. Life is
          amazing.

          While the first quarter of 2021 was kinda bumpy, I'm excited for the
          rest of the year.
