            Almost 5 months since my last update, <em>what is up?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my new role at Customer.io and so far so good! I'm trying
            not to jinx it but I'm fortunate to have a nice team, great leaders,
            and working on a product I love. I think it really makes a
            difference. It's pretty exciting to help people extract the most out
            of it everyday.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be spending a few days in Gasp√©sie next week to see my old
            roomate, get some marine air, and hopefully take some nice pictures
            after almost 18 months without any photos...
          </p>
          <p>
            These days I'm playing mostly Apex Legends (pretty proud of my 20%
            win rate and 1 KD this season), Microsoft Flight Simulator, and
            bouncing between Red Dead Online, Grounded, and Back4Blood Beta the
            rest of the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite a uncooperative weather, my garden has been doing pretty
            good. This year, I wanted to experiment with new species and I have
            had so much fun seeing my cucamelons, casper eggplants, etc...
            growing. So yummy!
          </p>

            Now, with the upcoming Fall and although I'm vaccinated, I'm
            wondering about how the pandemic will shape the cold seaons.
