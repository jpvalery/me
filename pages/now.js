        <p>Well... 2020 was a effing dumpster fire, wasn't it?</p>
        <p>I'm hoping 2021 will be better (<em>as everyone probably is</em>) but let's say that I'm cautiously optimistic. Let's see how things are after our latest lockdown.</p>
        <p>On the bright side, I think the dumpster fire allowed me to really figure out what was important for me and what I wanted from my life.</p>
        <p>We also had a great harvest in our veggie garden over the summer and I converted my landlord and neighbor to the joy of growing your own food.</p>
        <p>I also built a flight sim chair out of wood and a recycled auto seat, as well as a custom joystick with an Arduino and some soldered buttons.</p>
        <p>These days I'm playing mostly Apex Legends and Rainbow Six Siege. The latest Red Dead Online update was a bloody joke and literally made me churn from the game. I've also started <a href="https://lichess.org/@/jpvalery">playing chess online</a> and I'm neither great nor terrible.</p>
        <p>I've been reading a lot of books on self-sufficiency and homesteading. I've also started preparing for the next growing seasons and can't wait to receive my order of seeds.</p>
        <p>Oh and, you've guessed it, I'm cleaning up my websites and domains. Kinda like spring cleaning but with DNS records and code and it's winter.</p>
        <p><em>Also wondering if I should save these updates as some sort of seasonal journal.</em></p>
