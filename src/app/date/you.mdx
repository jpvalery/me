## TL;DR

You're someone with depth and passion, who lights up talking about what she loves and isn't afraid to be real about what she wants. You're curious, kind, a little quirky, warm. You're up for spontaneous adventures and deep conversations in equal measure.

You're a woman somewhere around 29–39. You speak English or French. You don't want kids. You're intrigued by a French-Canadian guy in Montréal who flies planes for fun and has a bazillion niche interests.

You may or may not tick all of these because this could look different than I imagine—if your gut feeling is telling you we'd be a match, I'd like to hear from you regardless.

## What Draws Me to Someone

The spark. Not chemistry alone—though that matters—but the way someone talks about what they care about. The light in their eyes when they go down a rabbit hole. The unapologetic passion for something, anything, whether it's niche pastry or 1970s NYT crosswords or something I've never heard of.

I connect best with people who are complex, attuned to who they are, and unafraid of their own interests and desires. People who aren't performing a life but actually living one.

I'm not looking for someone who shares all my hobbies. I'm looking for someone who *has* hobbies—and who gets why I have mine.

## The Energy I'm Looking For

Curious. Kind. Quirky. A little pixie energy, maybe. Warm and caring.

Someone who asks questions—not just polite ones, but the kind that pull on a thread to see where it goes. Someone who can hold space for a deep conversation about our place among the stars and then pivot to debating pizza toppings with equal enthusiasm.

Humor matters. I'm very deadpan—dry, sarcastic, second-degree. It throws people off at first because my delivery is convincing enough that they think I'm serious. If you can volley that back, we're going to have a lot of fun.

## How We'd Spend Time

I'll make time for you, but I also need my alone time—and I'll give you yours. I'm not looking for codependence. I want a partner, not a merging.

I'd love to share my passions with you. You're welcome in the cockpit, in the garden, in the kitchen while I'm kneading dough. And I want to see yours: show me what lights you up.

My friends and family matter to me. Once we reach a certain level of commitment, I want you to meet them. You don't have to come to every hangout (there will be boys' nights and adventures) but I want someone who's interested in being part of my world, not staying on the edges. And I'm not interested in being the mysterious boyfriend either.

Double dates? Love them. Travel? Yes—even just a weekend somewhere. I like having the outlines planned with room for serendipity.

Some weekends will be adventures. Some will be cooking together and watching a show on the couch. Both are great.

## What I Want You to Feel

When you're around me, I want you to feel safe. Listened to. Appreciated. Stimulated.

What I offer is care without conditions, comfort without games. A past partner told me that being with me recalibrated what she thought a relationship could feel like—that consistent kindness, with no hidden motives, was something she didn't know she was missing until she experienced it.

## What Loving Me Is Like

I'm an acts-of-service and gifts person—but the thoughtful kind, not the flashy kind. I'll remember small things you mentioned and find something connected to them later. I'll fix annoyances you didn't ask me to fix. That's how I show up.

I'm honest and transparent, sometimes uncomfortably so. I expect the same. I give my trust easily, but if it breaks, it's hard to repair.

While I welcome however you choose to express love and appreciation, a few caveats: I'm tough to shop for. I tend to splurge on things I want, so by the time a gift-giving occasion rolls around, I've already bought it myself. I'm also not the best at receiving compliments and other words of affirmation, but I've been working on being more comfortable accepting them.

## Long Term

I'm open to different dynamics. The only non-negotiable: no kids. I've had a vasectomy. DINK lifestyle—or DINKWAD (dual income no kids, with a dog).

I'm not actively looking to get married, but I'm not opposed to it either. I wouldn't want a big expensive party though.

Long term, I'd want to share a home—but find *our* place together, not move into yours or have you move into mine. That said, I'm also open to the idea that living separately could work. I used to think cohabitation was essential; now I'm less certain.

What I'm sure about: I want a true partner. Someone to build with, grow with, make memories with—for as long as it's good for both of us.
