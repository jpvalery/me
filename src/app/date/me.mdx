## TL;DR

French-born, Montréal-based, 34. I fly planes, 3D print things (including a guitar), grow plants, bake pizza from scratch, and have strong opinions about how to prepare food.

I'm looking for a long-term partner with depth, passions of her own, and a spark in her eyes when she talks about what she loves. I'll probably cook you great meals, pebble you with small thoughtful gifts, and plan weekend adventures.

Fair warning: I've had a vasectomy, so if kids are in your plans, we won't be a match.

## The Basics

I'm Jp. 34 years old, 5'11" (_not rounding up to 6', honesty matters_), currently based in Montréal—born in Southern France where I spent the first 22 years of my life before crossing the Atlantic and immigrating to Québec.

By day, I work in tech as a Customer Success Engineer. I've been helping people do more with email for over a decade, both as a sender and on the vendor side. It's stimulating work at the intersection of what I'm good at and what I enjoy nerding out on—but it's not my whole personality or identity.

I'm happy to travel, but I don't plan to relocate outside of Québec for the foreseeable future.

## What I'm Into

Most people eventually ask me: *"Is there something you don't know how to do?"*

The truth is, every time I find an answer to that question, I eliminate it. Not knowing how to do something just means I've unlocked a new sidequest.

**In the air:** I earned my Private Pilot License in 2024. In 2025, I added a Night Rating and started aerobatics training. Next up: Multi-Engine and Floats ratings. The sky, it turns out, is not the limit. This started as a childhood dream and became a real part of my life.

**On the ground:** I'm usually gardening (_or in winter, convincing a mango tree to survive in Montréal_), 3D printing more or less useful contraptions, or cooking something from scratch. I bake pretty great pizzas—homemade dough, the whole thing. If you need to gauge how serious I am about that craft, I own a 30-pound encyclopedia on pizza.

**Through a lens:** I used to shoot photography more seriously—my photos have been viewed over 294 million times on Unsplash. These days I mostly point my phone at things, or occasionally dust off a fully mechanical film camera.

**In the background:** Music is a constant. I spend a good chunk of my waking hours with something playing. I also play guitar and bass—and yes, I 3D printed one of my guitars, because why wouldn't I.

I need to express creativity, whether artistically (photography, music), practically (designing and printing tools), or organically (growing things from seed).

## Who I Am

I'm an INFJ, and people who've known me for years will tell you it's almost unsettlingly accurate.

At first, I usually come across as introverted, reserved, maybe a little quiet. I'm an ambivert at heart—give me time to warm up and you'll see the other side. I've been told I'm like a good wine: the more time you invest in getting to know me, the more there is to appreciate.

I'm curious by default. I get passionate quickly and deeply. When something clicks, I can lose hours in a flow state without noticing.

I have my rituals and my ways. Maybe it's a little OCD, maybe it's superstition—or just a little stition. I won't be mad if you cut peppers inefficiently, but I might wince internally.

I'm funny. That sounds cocky written down, but it's been a consistent compliment, so I'm claiming it.

I'm extremely authentic. No games, no performances. My bazillion passions are all real. I have high standards for things and people, mostly because I hold myself to even higher ones.

I'm vocal when I'm pleased and when I'm not. I don't shy away from conflict, but I'll never raise my voice. Disagreement doesn't mean disrespect.

I prefer explicit communication. I'm not always great at picking up on hints or innuendo, so if you're thinking something, just tell me. I'll do the same.

## What I'm Looking For

**The short version:**

You're someone with depth and passion, who lights up talking about what you love and isn't afraid to be real about what you want. You're up for spontaneous adventures and deep conversations in equal measure.

**The longer version:**

I want a true partner. Someone to build great memories with, to elevate each other, and to enjoy each other's company for as long as it's pleasant and fulfilling for both of us.

I'm drawn to people with their own niches and hobbies. I genuinely don't care what it is—birdwatching, fermentation, competitive Tetris—I just want to see the spark. What I'm not drawn to: surface-level interests, or what I sometimes call "people being sims" or "LARPing their lives."

I'd love someone who shares my curiosity, or at least appreciates it. Bonus points if you speak French (I'm happy to teach—could be an excuse to visit my native lands in the south of France).

## How I Love

My love languages are **acts of service** and **gifts**—but not the overwhelming, expensive kind.

I'm a pebbler. I'll remember something you mentioned on our second date and find something connected to it weeks later. You'll say something annoyed you (but not enough to fix it yourself), and I'll quietly solve it. That's how I show I'm paying attention.

I'm working on vocalizing things more, but my instinct is to *show* rather than tell.

I'm honest and transparent, sometimes to a fault. I expect the same. Once I start feeling like someone isn't being straight with me—even without ill intent—it's hard for me to recover.

I give my trust easily. But if it's broken, it's *really* hard to patch up.

What past partners have told me, sometimes years later: they remember my kindness, my warmth, my dedication, and my passion.

## Life & Logistics

**Health stuff:** I lost over 100 pounds in 2024 and committed to an active lifestyle—at least 30 minutes of movement every day. I kept a healthy relationship with food and don't mind splurging sometimes, but this is part of who I am now. You don't have to match my intensity, but respecting it matters.

**Pets:** My lease says no, but I love all animals (and they tend to love me). I dog-sit my friends' golden retriever a few times a year—she's basically my furry niece. Also, I have a worm compost. They count, right?

**Dating style:** I like to plan a bit ahead—my life is busy between work, flight lessons, friends, and staying active—but I also love a spontaneous "let's grab dinner." I prefer texting (everyone can reply when convenient), and I tend to respond fast but don't expect the same. I love weekend adventures.

## Fair Warnings

Some things worth knowing upfront so neither of us wastes time:

- **I've had a vasectomy.** If kids are part of your vision, we're not aligned.
- **I need depth.** If your interests are mostly surface-level, we probably won't click.
- **Aviation is non-negotiable.** You don't have to fly with me every time, but this is something important that I want to share—and won't sacrifice.
- **I'm left-leaning.** We don't need to be perfectly aligned politically, but we should be in the same neighborhood.
- **I need some baseline of activity.** You don't have to be a gym person, but completely sedentary won't work.
- **I value smarts.** Not "good at school" smart—more like "can follow a logical thread" smart.
