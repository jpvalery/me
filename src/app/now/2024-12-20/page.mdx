Taking on the opportunity of a front-end refresh, it seems that making this update even once a year is a bigger task than I thought.

In the Fall of 2023, I decided to focus all my personal time and energy on my goal of obtaining my Private Pilot Licence and getting back in shape.

I'm super proud that both objectives were reached within 6 months. I obtained my PPL in June 2024 and my first milestone/target weight by the same time. Ultimately, I've lost about 50 kg or 110 lbs in 2024 and I'm now in the best shape I've been in over 15 years. This is extremely satisfying.

I'm looking ahead to 2025 and excited about the opportunities and challenges that await me.
