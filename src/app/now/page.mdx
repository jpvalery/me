The second half of 2025 was busy.

Work took me to Vegas for React Conf, then to Florence for Resend's annual offsite. I extended the Europe trip to spend some time in France with family—always good for the soul. End of January, I'm heading to San Francisco and Salt Lake City.

Aerobatics training has ramped up. I can now perform loops, rolls, and more complex maneuvers like the clover leaf (chaining 4 rolls, pulling up to 5G) and the Avalanche (a snap roll at the top of a loop). It's intense and I love it. I'm also considering adding Multi-Engine and Floats ratings to my license this year.

Over the summer, I biked almost 1,500km, including a 100km single-day ride. That was a first.

Still chipping away at a side project to help pilots offset their carbon emissions—hoping to finally ship it in Q1 with some help from Claude Code.
