It seems I can only make this updates once a year

Life has remained chaotic but also full of positive surprises.

I've finally taken the leap and I've started training to become a Private Pilot! The learning has been brutal (it's been almost 10 years since I was on a school bench) but also very interesting. I'm hoping to pass my final exam in the first half of 2024.

I've also finally taken another leap and incorporated a company to start monetizing some projects and overall have a corporate umbrella for whatever new shiny thing I'd feel like working on.

After many challenges with the project of building a large format camera from 3D printed parts, I recognized defeat and splurged on an Intrepid Mk IV 4x5. The picture quality is bonkers and it's very fun to shoot.

I had an objective to ride 1,500km on my bike this summer (up from 1,200km last summer), but disappointing weather as well as forest fires made this a more complicated challenge than I expected. It's clearly a bummer.
