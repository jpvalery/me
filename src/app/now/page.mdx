Since December 2024, a lot has shifted in my world.

After four years at Customer.io, I decided it was time for a new challenge. I joined Resend as a Customer Success Engineer, stepping into a role that blends deep technical problem-solving with the customer focus I've always thrived on. The transition has been energizing, and it’s been exciting to work with a team that moves fast and builds with care.

On the aviation front, I earned my night rating earlier this year—flying under the stars never gets old. I’ve also started training in aerobatics. It’s a humbling experience to be pushed (literally and figuratively) in new ways, but incredibly rewarding.

I shipped a project called [FLAPS](https://github.com/jpvalery/flaps), a small utility designed to help simplify and automate flight planning and related workflows. It’s been fun scratching a personal itch and seeing it resonate with other pilots. I’m also working on a new side project aimed at helping pilots offset their carbon emissions—blending my love of flying with a growing sense of responsibility around sustainability.

Travel has picked up again. I had the chance to visit both Barcelona and Iowa City for work—two very different but equally interesting experiences. I also spent a week in Las Vegas to celebrate one of my best friends' 40th birthday, which was a perfect mix of chaos, laughter, and nostalgia.

All in all, I’m in a season of change and forward motion—sharpening old skills, building new ones, and enjoying the ride.
