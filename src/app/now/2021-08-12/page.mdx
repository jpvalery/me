Almost 5 months since my last update, _what is up_?

I started my new role at Customer.io and so far so good! I'm trying not to jinx it but I'm fortunate to have a nice team, great leaders, and working on a product I love. I think it really makes a difference. It's pretty exciting to help people extract the most out of it everyday.

I'll be spending a few days in Gasp√©sie next week to see my old roomate, get some marine air, and hopefully take some nice pictures after almost 18 months without any photos...

These days I'm playing mostly Apex Legends (pretty proud of my 20% win rate and 1 KD this season), Microsoft Flight Simulator, and bouncing between Red Dead Online, Grounded, and Back4Blood Beta the rest of the time.

Despite a uncooperative weather, my garden has been doing pretty good. This year, I wanted to experiment with new species and I have had so much fun seeing my cucamelons, casper eggplants, etc... growing. So yummy!

Now, with the upcoming Fall and although I'm vaccinated, I'm wondering about how the pandemic will shape the cold seaons.
