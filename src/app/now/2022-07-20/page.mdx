Almost a year since my last update, _what is up_?

Life has been a bit chaotic, not gonna lie

Between traveling to France for an emergency, trying to buy a house in the worse market in Canada's history, and separating with my long-term partner, I have to admit that it's been a bit more chaotic than I hoped.

On the brighter side, I was promoted to Team Lead at Customer.io and that new challenge has been fulfilling. It strikes a nice balance of captain/player and makes for totally not boring weeks.

With the waves of Covid, I haven't really traveled nor did I find the energy to plan the next travel. For a time I wanted to work remotely in the US and enjoy the nomadic privilege, but with the gas prices being where they were, this plan fizzled.

I've invested in an electric bike earlier this year and this is one of the best investment I made in a while. I've already biked over 700km in less than 6 months and I'm eager to keep beating my records.

As always, games take a good chunk of my time. I've been a bit burnt out by Apex and found new excitement in Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Generation Zero.
