Well... 2020 was a effing dumpster fire, wasn't it?

I'm hoping 2021 will be better (_as everyone probably is_) but let's say that I'm cautiously optimistic. Let's see how things are after our latest lockdown.

On the bright side, I think the dumpster fire allowed me to really figure out what was important for me and what I wanted from my life.

We also had a great harvest in our veggie garden over the summer and I converted my landlord and neighbor to the joy of growing your own food.

I also built a flight sim chair out of wood and a recycled auto seat, as well as a custom joystick with an Arduino and some soldered buttons.

These days I'm playing mostly Apex Legends and Rainbow Six Siege. The latest Red Dead Online update was a bloody joke and literally made me churn from the game. I've also started{" "} [playing chess online](https://lichess.org/@/jpvalery) and I'm neither great nor terrible.

I've been reading a lot of books on self-sufficiency and homesteading. I've also started preparing for the next growing seasons and can't wait to receive my order of seeds.

Oh and, you've guessed it, I'm cleaning up my websites and domains. Kinda like spring cleaning but with DNS records and code and it's winter.

_Also wondering if I should save these updates as some sort of seasonal journal._
