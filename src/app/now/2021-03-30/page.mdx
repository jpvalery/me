2021 started pretty crazyâ€”no reasons to change the winning recipe of 2020, eh?

I left my role at Local Logic in February. I tried to get alignment on my future at the company after blowing past all my objectives and working non-stop for a year. I was told to quit. So, I went yolo and did just that.

I have to say I'm pretty proud of me for doing so. It was both a crazy and a courageous choice to draw the line and say "no more". I think that a few years ago I would have kept enduring the abuse and toxicity, rather than calling it quits

Fortis Fortuna Adiuvat as they say.

I got a couple of freelancing gigs to keep me busy while I was enjoying funemployment and I landed a role at Customer.io as a Customer Success Manager. If you ran into me over the past few years and we chatted about marketing automation, there's a 99.999% chance I annoyed you with how freaking awesome Customer.io is as a product. So, I couldn't be more excited to be joining this team.

These days I'm playing mostly Apex Legends, Dead by Daylight, H:CotW. I'm looking forward to jumping back a bit more on Flight Simulator, especially with an Oculus Quest on the way.

I've started my seedlings for the season and as usual I'm just amazed by these lil' plants making their way up through the soil. Life is amazing.

While the first quarter of 2021 was kinda bumpy, I'm excited for the rest of the year.
