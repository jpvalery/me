				This is currently just me, Jp. Born in France, moved to Montréal a
				couple of years ago. Now a dual citizen.
				<br />
				I started an indie musical label when I was 16, began my professional
				careers in non-profits and freelancing. Then, when I moved to Montréal,
				I got into the big corporate world at Gameloft. Dabbled in a couple of
				things between video games, robotics, ecommerce, music industry,
				startups, artificial intelligence...
				<br />
				As a person, I&apos;m a photographer with over 130M views, an avid video
				game player, and a gardening enthusiast.

				Because I&apos;m 100% bullshit free and I was described in my last gigs
				as &quot;
				<em>one of the most impactful hires [they] made</em>&quot;, &quot;
				<em>a growth rockstar</em>&quot;, &quot;
				<em>the best bridge between teams</em>&quot;...
				<br />
				From pre-series A startups to worldwide conglomerate, I&apos;ve proved
				time and time again to be an asset that yield results.

				I&apos;m here to share my knowledge, experience, and expertise to fuel
				sustainable growth for digital produts
				<br />I can bring you what worked, what didn&apos;t, why, what tools to
				use, what errors to avoid, what decisions to take today to yield 100X
				benefits down the road...

				I&apos;ve reached a point where I know what I do, what I like, and what
				I bring to the table.
				<br />
				I also know what bores me, what angers me, and the patterns to
				toxic/annoying/misleading/bullshitty projects.
				<br />
				So, I&apos;m being super radical and transparent in those questions so
				we can both save time and energy.
